# First, let's give ourselves an origin to work with.

origin = Abstract() # This just makes a plain abstract with a default location and distortion.
ROOT.add_child_relative(origin)

# Abstracts have to be underneath ROOT somewhere in the heirachy to get processed.

# Otherwise, it ends up in its own little pocket universe where nothing gets recognised by 
# the engine and it just sits around taking up memory. Wish I could do that irl ngl

# That's why we have to use add_child_relative() whenever we make a new abstract to put it
# in the heirachy.


# You might be wondering why we make an abstract to use as an origin in the heirachy
# considering it's exactly the same as ROOT.

# This is because modifying ROOT will probably break something and I don't want to find out
# what ðŸ’€




# Now, let's make a vessel for our player to control.

player = Abstract(Matrix([[0],
                          [0],
                          [-4]])) # Here, we're specifying where our abstract is with an 
                                  # xyz location vector.

origin.add_child_relative(player) # To clarify, this function moves the child you're adding
                                  # so its location relative to the parent is what its 
                                  # objective location used to be.
                                  
                                  # So far, we've only added children to stuff at the origin,
                                  # but later we'll add some where this becomes important.
                                  
# It would probably be useful if the player has the option to see the game. Let's give them
# a camera to see it with!

camera = Camera(ORIGIN, I3, 60) # Here, we set its location and its distortion as well as
                                # its field of view in degrees.
player.add_child_relative(camera)

# This is the first time distortion has shown up, so I'll do my best to explain it:

# An abstract's distortion is a 3x3 matrix containing three xyz vectors in a row. Each one 
# is the location that each of the axial vectors get warped to.

# To imagine what this means, flip yourself off with your left hand.

# Your thumb represents our X-axial vector at [[1],
#                                              [0],
#                                              [0]], 

# your middle finger represents the Y at [[0],
#                                         [1],
#                                         [0]] 

# and your index finger represents the Z at [[0],
#                                            [0],
#                                            [1]].

# These combine together to make the I3 matrix, [[1, 0, 0],
#                                                [0, 1, 0], 
#                                                [0, 0, 1]]!

# Now, let's say you want to rotate an abstract. We can do this by changing the distortion:

# Flip yourself off again but now rotate your hand 90 degrees clockwise. Your middle finger
# should be pointing to the right, your thumb should be pointing down and your index finger
# should be the same.

# Now, let's think about the coordinates the tips of your fingers have been mapped to:

# Your thumb is now pointing directly down, which is going to be negative on the Y axis. So,
# our X axial vector is now at [[0],
#                               [-1],
#                               [0]].

# Your middle finger is pointing to the right, which is positive on the X axis: [[1],
#                                                                                [0],
#                                                                                [0]]

# and your index finger is still at [[0],
#                                    [0],
#                                    [1]].

# So, to rotate our abstract by 90 degrees around the Z axis, we make its distortion 
# [[0, 1, 0],
#  [-1, 0, 0], 
#  [0, 0, 1]]! (you can stop flipping yourself off now)

# Similarly, we can represent any orientation with a matrix like this, and we can even stretch,
# squash or reflect our abstract by changing the magnitude of our axial vectors. (Don't do that
# with your fingers!) If you'd like to learn more, search for maths resources on linear algebra.

# Moving on!

 
# Hearing is also pretty useful, so we'll give them the option for that as well.

ears = Listener(1, 2) # Important distinction:

                          # Volume (the first one) is how loud sound is played back to the 
                          # player's speakers.
                          
                          # Sensitivity is how well it picks up sound in 3D space.
                          
                          # Ultimately, they're pretty similar, but just bear that in mind.
